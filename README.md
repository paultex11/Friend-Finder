# Friend-Finder

Project Brief

A compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app which is full-stack site that takes in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

MVP:

User will have 10 multiple choice questions to answer. Each answer is on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.

Once the user click submit button the app finds the current user's most compatible friend, display the result as a modal pop-up. The modal displays both the name and picture of the closest match.
